    description: "The Volkswagen Taigo is essentially a coupe-SUV version of the Volkswagen T-Cross, introduced to European markets in 2021 (previously launched in South America as the Nivus in 2020). Built on the MQB A0 platform, the Taigo features a distinctive sloping roofline that differentiates it from its more upright T-Cross sibling. Despite the sportier silhouette, it maintains reasonable rear headroom and cargo space. The front fascia incorporates LED headlights connected by a light bar on higher trims, while the interior features Volkswagen's digital cockpit and infotainment system with a standard 8-inch or optional 9.2-inch touchscreen. Powertrain options include 1.0-liter three-cylinder and 1.5-liter four-cylinder TSI petrol engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 95 to 150 horsepower, paired with manual or DSG automatic transmissions. The Taigo is front-wheel drive only, focusing on style and on-road dynamics rather than off-road capability. Standard and available safety features include lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and autonomous emergency braking. The Taigo represents Volkswagen's entry into the compact coupe-SUV segment, appealing to style-conscious buyers wanting something more distinctive than a conventional crossover."
